Revision history for DBIx-Class-Fixtures

1.001012
- Added new method 'available_config_sets' which returns and caches a list of
  all the json set configs found in the 'config_dir' directory.  This was added
  to make it easier when you need to dump all the fixtures programatically.
- Added method 'dump_all_config_sets' which helps automate dumping all your 
  current config sets to a directory.  

1.001011
- Added an excludes resultsource option to the ->dump({all=>1,...}) feature
- Allow you to directly set a configuration via a Perl HashRef instead of a
  JSON file.  Useful for testing and when you have simple or generated configs.
- New option to force use of ->create rather than ->populate.
- Fixed a bug in the test suite that would fail on certain JSON parsers

1.001010
- Fixed docs to use double quotes which is valid JSON

1.001009
- Force operations to work inside a transaction so with_deferred_fks actually works.

1.001008
- Man, I should test better.

1.001007
- Should use Schema->source(), not ->resultset().

1.001006
- Schema->resultset() throws an exception, not return undef, when it can't find
  a moniker.

1.001005
- Fixed problem where rules containing an override of has_many weren't applied
  correctly.

  relationships wouldn't get the second belongs_to.
