1.001023  2014-08-13 22:20:17+01:00 Europe/London
- No change from last version

1.001021_01
- add in option use_find_or_create

1.001021
- Applied patch to solve issue when trying to copy fixtures across volumes

1.001020
- Bumped some dependencies to stop cpan tester fails.

1.001019
- Fixed issue when using fixtures and parallel testing (such as prove -j9 ...)

1.001018
- Reduced the size of a PK in the fixtures to stop (hopefully) some occasional
  error reports

1.001017
- POD fixes (justin hunter++)
- Changed the test suite so it doesn't mindlessly break with the changes
  introduced by DBIC 0.08200 (nerox++ for bug report).

1.001016
- Support more Postgresql types for datetime_relative (added TIME, DATE,
  INTERVAL, TIMESTAMP)
- If $result_source->column_info defines a sequence, make sure we properly
  set that sequence to whatever the max value currently is.

1.001015
- ::External::File makes the path if its missing

1.001014
- Allow you to perform value substitutions inside config-sets
- Added a framework to allow you to backup / restore data external to the
  database as part of your fixtures.  Added an external handler for File
  based data, and docs and tests for this.

1.001013
- fixed functionality in last release by more deeply cloning parameters, which
  prevents bad things when parameters get deleted in the wrong places.  Also 
  be sure we clear state properly after a dump.

1.001012
- Added new method 'available_config_sets' which returns and caches a list of
  all the json set configs found in the 'config_dir' directory.  This was added
  to make it easier when you need to dump all the fixtures programatically.
- Added method 'dump_config_sets' to let you dump more than one set at a time
  more easily
- Added method 'dump_all_config_sets' which helps automate dumping all your 
  current config sets to a directory.  

1.001011
- Added an excludes resultsource option to the ->dump({all=>1,...}) feature
- Allow you to directly set a configuration via a Perl HashRef instead of a
  JSON file.  Useful for testing and when you have simple or generated configs.
- New option to force use of ->create rather than ->populate.
- Fixed a bug in the test suite that would fail on certain JSON parsers

1.001010
- Fixed docs to use double quotes which is valid JSON

1.001009
- Force operations to work inside a transaction so with_deferred_fks actually works.

1.001008
- Man, I should test better.

1.001007
- Should use Schema->source(), not ->resultset().

1.001006
- Schema->resultset() throws an exception, not return undef, when it can't find
  a moniker.

1.001005
- Fixed problem where rules containing an override of has_many weren't applied
  correctly.

1.001004
- Fixed problem where descending a has_many to something with two belongs_to
  relationships wouldn't get the second belongs_to.

1.001003
- Fix t/var/configs/*.json to use valid JSON syntax
- Fixed DateTime::Format dependencies

1.001002
- Allow passing schema object to ->populate
- Check that fixture population dir was created

1.001001
- debug defaults to 0 rather than undef
- cleanup only deletes what's necessary
- added db specific dbi files so that postgres can use deferrable

1.001000
- Added includes functionality
- Added post_ddl and cascade attributes to populate (Drew Taylor)
- Scalar refs in cond clauses handled in sets as well as fetches (Sebastian Willert)
- Directory separators in primary keys do not cause a crash (Sebastian Willert)
- Optimised populate to take advantage of insert_bulk (Drew Taylor)

1.000001
- Added missing deps

1.000000
- Released
